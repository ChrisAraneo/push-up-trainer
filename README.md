## Introduction

**Have you ever been training and asked yourself:**

**"<em>Why do I have to count all my repetitions, and how can I better manage my rest time between sets?</em>"**

Push Up Trainer is designed to help you track repetitions and maintain proper timing between series during your workouts. The web application features a countdown timer with customizable settings, making it perfect for extended training sessions by eliminating the need to count all repetitions and manage rest time periods.

## How to use the app?

**1. Customize your training plan**

Your push-up training plan can be divided into series. For example, you can perform 3 series of 10 push-ups each. First, click the Edit button in the Training plan section. You can set the number of series and the number of repetitions per series in the input fields. You can set the time for each series in seconds. For example, you can set 30 seconds to complete each series. This way you can do for example 3 series of 10 push-ups each and you will have 30 seconds to complete each 10 repetitions. When you are done customizing your plan, click the Save button.

**2. Start your workout**

You can start your workout by clicking the Start button. The timer will play audio and count down from 5 seconds, giving you time to place your phone on the ground and get ready.

Then the first series will begin. You need to complete all the repetitions you set up, counting them yourself. For example, if your training plan is 5 series of 10 push-ups each, you only have to count your push-ups in current series, from 1 to 10. You don't have to worry about counting the total push-ups. This method is well tested by the author and is working very well.

When you finish the series, take a short break before the next series. The timer will play a sound to signal the end of the break and the start of the next series.

You can pause the timer at any time by clicking the Pause button. You can resume the timer by clicking the Resume button. You can stop the workout at any time by clicking the Stop button. When you stop the workout, the timer settings will reset.

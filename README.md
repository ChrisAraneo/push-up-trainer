  <em>Push-up workout trainer with timer and series tracking</em>
  <br>
</p>

## Introduction

**Have you ever been training and asked yourself:**

**"<em>Why do I have to count all my repetitions, and how can I better manage my rest time between sets?</em>"**

Push Up Trainer is designed to help you track repetitions and maintain proper timing between series during your push-up workouts. The web application features a countdown timer with customizable settings, making it perfect for extended training sessions by eliminating the need to manually count repetitions and manage rest time periods.
